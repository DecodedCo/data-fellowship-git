## One way to git mastery

* This project is designed to teach the basics of using Git.
* We will be using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to get started
* Over time you will learn to use the terminal as well to run your git commands
* You will be making a profile page for yourself
* You will be adding a link to your page, from the home page
* You will learn do Pull Requests's on your buddy's work
* You will learn to handle conflicts in your work
* You will learn what a diff is, a history, a log, a commit, a push, a conflict, a merge and a pull request


## Little bits of information

### Markdown tips

* You will use Markdown to write your page.
* Italics in markdown are done with `_`_surrounding_`_` the content
* Bold is done with `**`**surrounding**`**` the content
* Headings are done with `#`. You can use up to 5 `#`. 1 is very important, 5 is least important
* Lists can be done with `*` as bullet points or `1.`, `2.` etc as a numbered list
* Images can be added with `![description](/git-tutorial/images/imagename.ext)`
* Links to other pages can be added with `[link text](/filename.html)`
